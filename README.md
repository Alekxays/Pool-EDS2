## 🐍 Pool | EDS (Python)

Welcome to my repository for the second-year pool at Epitech Digital School! 🎓

This repo contains all the exercises I submitted during the pool. It showcases my journey in learning and mastering Python programming concepts through a variety of challenges.

**⚠️ A Friendly Reminder**

While you are free to explore and learn from my code, I strongly discourage copying and pasting it without understanding how it works. Instead, I encourage you to:

	1.	🧐 Read the code carefully.
	2.	🧩 Decipher the logic and processes.
	3.	🔧 Experiment with your own solutions!

💡 Remember: There is no single way to write code. My solutions are just one of many possibilities to solve the exercises you’re looking at. 🚀

## 📂 Content

This repository includes exercises written in Python, covering a wide range of programming topics such as:

	•	📚 Basics: Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
	•	🔗 Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
	•	⚙️ Algorithms: Problem-solving approaches with Pythonic solutions.
	•	📈 Advanced Topics: File handling, OOP, modules, and more.

## 🛠️ Usage

**1. Clone the Repository**

	git clone https://github.com/Alekxays/Pool-EDS2.git
	cd Pool-EDS2

**2. Explore and Learn**

Each exercise is organized into folders with descriptive names for easy navigation.
